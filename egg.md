# How to cook the perfect egg

How to cook the perfect hard boiled egg. 
It is important to approach this from a scientific perspective. 
The egg white solidifies at a much higher temperature compared to the egg yolk. 
Hence, the cooking procedure must be changed depending on whether you want a well done egg or a slightly runny egg. 
These instructions is for a large egg, you should adjust them depending on the exact size of your egg. 
If you are cooking more than 5 eggs, you may want to increase the times slightly. 
These instructions are designed so that a thermometer is not needed. 

## Slightly soft egg

This is by far the more delicious egg since it is more tender and the egg yolk won't get caught in your throat.

### Ingredients

1. One large egg

### Procedure

1. Select the right egg. An extremely fresh egg will be harder to peel later since the inner membrane will still be tightly stuck to the shell. Best leave the egg in the fridge for 3-4 days before cooking.
1. Fill a pot with enough water to cover the egg and pot it on the electric stove to max heat. Do not put the egg in yet!
1. Once the water is almost boiled. That is, bubbles start to consistently rise but not vigourously yet. Put the egg in carefully with a spoon so as to not crack the egg.
1. Cover the pot for about 1 min, until the water starts to boil.
1. Turn off the heat (or turn to lowest if gas stove). Leave the pot covered.
1. Wait 9 minutes (7-8 min for a more runny egg)
1. Take the egg out and put it into a bath of ice (or cold) water and let it sit for 30 seconds or so.
1. When peeling the egg hit it on a hard surface to form the initial crack. Afterwards, for the rest of the cracks by hitting it on your knuckle. This is more gentle.
1. Once the egg is cracked, peel it starting from the pointy end. It may be easier to peel under running cold water.
1. You are done. The perfect egg!
