# Introduction
This quals guide is for people with the main focus of "Signals" and "Systems".
It is well known that these areas are traditionally harder than the other popular
areas. However, with adequate preparation, there should be no problems 
passing quals with these as your primary areas. 

Thanks to my quals buddies for many of the ideas on this page and their support 
during quals! Jaime, Derek, Frank, Qiuhua, Shangping, Yu, Yifan, Wendy, Eddy and Mandy. 

The guide is incomplete but still useful. 
Also, the information is outdated since the quals process has since changed.

# General advice

Find an advisor before taking quals. This may be hard, but at least make an effort.

# Quals groups

Unless you are a born genius, the single most important preparation task 
is to form or join a quals group. The purpose of a quals group is to 
practice answering questions under pressure and also hopefully have a 
supportive environment for when the pressure of quals hits. 

*How to form a group:* The most common way is to leave your
contact details on the [quals forums](https://ccnet.stanford.edu/quals/).
Another good way is to try and find older students to recommend a group. Most
people join multiple quals groups in order to get more practice and motivation. 
This also allows you to leave one if you don't click with the other members. 

*Ideal size:* The idea size of a group is 4 or 6 people. Odd numbered 
groups will have trouble running quals simulations. Groups with many people will
be bogged down with long meetings.

*How often should meetings be held?:* At least one or two meetings per week staring early in 
autumn quarter is a minimum. The frequency usually picks up after thanksgiving. Each meeting lasts about
2 hours. Any longer and people start falling asleep. 

*Meeting format:* A two phase format is common and seems to works well. Starting with 
the older quals questions or quals like questions obtained from elsewhere, each person prepares
a solution to different question. In phase one, each person goes to the whiteboard and presents
the question, 10-12 minutes is given to solve the problem and then the solution is given. Then 
10 min is spent discussing the solution and the key concepts to remember if required. 
After thanksgiving phase two can begin. This is the simulation phase. Again each person prepares
the solution to a quals problem at home. Members go off in pairs to corners of the room and 
take turns in acting as the professor and the student. 10-12 min is allowed per question and
there is no discussion until everyone has answered every question. In this stage it is helpful
to consult with a student who has taken quals on how each professor acts during the
exam.

# Choosing professors

[Choosing professors](https://ee.stanford.edu/phd/quals/forms/prefs.cgi)
 is overly complicated. Essentially you select 4 groups of 5 
professors, this goes into Prof. Gill's magical algorithm and you get your final
10 examiners. Despite this apparent black box there are some strategies that
can be used to optimize your selection. 

*How does it work?:* There are 4 groups labeled 1,2,3 and 4, where
1 is your first preference and 4 is your last preference. In general, four professors
will be selected from group 1, three from group 2, two from group 3 and 1 from group 4. 
Hence, you ideally put your most favored professors in group 1 and so on. A further 
restriction is that only 6 professors from each area can be chosen. 

*Main strategy:* The main strategy in selecting professors is to exploit
the fact that every professor is human and has a limited amount of students he
or she can examine in one week. Some professors are well known to be popular
and are selected in group 1 and 2 by many students (You can ask older students
who they are). As a result, their quota is quickly exhausted. Hence, if a popular
professor is selected in group 3 or 4, it is highly unlikely that you will get
that professor as an examiner. You can use this to your advantage by selecting 
some popular professors not in your area of expertise in groups 3 and 4 since you will not get them anyway. 
This will boost the probability of getting the other less popular professors you
selected in those groups.

# On the day
About 3 days before your exam you will receive the timetable for your examination day.

*Example censored timetable email:* Everyone gets this email at the same time. This 
happens when the examination schedule has been finalized.

The times of your ten examinations are shown below.

1  Friday  10:00-10:12
2  Friday  10:24-10:36
3  Friday  10:48-11:00

The names of the examiners will be sent by email shortly after noon
on Tuesday, January 11.

The number of candidates scheduled this year is 154.

If you want to withdraw from the quals, you may do so without penalty
any time before your first exam.
```

*Example final timetable:* You get this about 3 days before your examination day. This date is 
different for everyone.

```
The Ph.D. Qualifying Examination consists of ten 12-minute sessions, all
on the same day.  Your schedule is shown below.

It is recommended that you visit your examiners' offices before your exam
day so that you will not have trouble locating offices on exam day.

Do not discuss the contents of the examinations with anyone until the
examination week is over.  Do not ask your examiners for an evaluation of
your performance.

Reminder: examiners may ask questions from their specified question areas
or from fundamental areas of mathematics, physics, or common sense.

*How to prepare for examination day:* Just treat it like 
any normal exam. Do your final reviews and get lots of sleep.

*What to wear on the day:* Just wear something neat 
and comfortable. You don't need to go overboard and wear
a suit jacket. Just remember that you will need to do a lot 
of walking!

*What to expect from the examiners:* This really depends
on the specific examiner. You should try to find out from past students
what how your examiners will examine you. Some will be very formal
and make you answer a list of questions. Others will simply
have a chat with you. I don't think it is appropriate to post
profiles of examiners that I have collected over the years here
so you will have to try and find out from your friends. 

*Other questions?:* [Contact me]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link contact.md %})! I will post the answers
here if appropriate. 

# What happens after?

There is about a 2 week wait before the results are released. Usually they are released in the
afternoon (about 5pm) after the committee meeting. 

*What happens if I pass?:* Congratulations! Just follow the instructions and you are fine.

*What happens if I don't pass?:* For people who are taking it the first time, this will generally
mean you will have to take it again. Only in very rare cases will your advisor file a petition if you 
don't pass the first time. If it is the second time, then generally your advisor will file a petition 
for you. So don't worry!
